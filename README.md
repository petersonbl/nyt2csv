# nyt2csv
A python script for creating csv files of New York Times articles through the use of the New York Times API.

The python script currently does work and will pull article titles, headings etc. from the NYT API, but it is not user friendly in the least as it was designed for use in my own research. Feel free to play with it though as it might be handy for other people interested in CATA.
